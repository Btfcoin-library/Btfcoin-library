👋 Hi, I’m @BTFCoinProject

👀 I’m interested in revolutionizing the blockchain space by building a decentralized mobile network that leverages quantum encryption for utmost security and inclusivity, making blockchain accessible to the everyday mobile user.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced quantum-safe cryptographic techniques to further fortify our transactions and data integrity, as well as optimizing the performance of our mobile nodes to handle large-scale network traffic with minimal resource consumption.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on enhancing the quantum encryption algorithms, improving the mobile app's user experience, and fine-tuning the consensus mechanism to ensure the network's stability and scalability. If you're a developer with expertise in cryptography, mobile development, or distributed systems, your insights and skills are highly welcome.

Project Overview
BTFCoin is determined to create a unique decentralized mobile blockchain ecosystem. Traditional blockchains rely on centralized servers, which have single points of failure and performance bottlenecks; encryption technology is also slightly vulnerable to the impact of quantum computing. We face the challenge, take mobile phones as the cornerstone of nodes, integrate cutting-edge quantum encryption, and open up a new path. Taking advantage of the widespread popularity of mobile phones, we attract global users and work together to build a stable, efficient and secure value transmission network.

Core Highlights
Decentralized Architecture
Abandoning the dependence on central servers, mobile phone nodes cooperate and check and balance each other. Transaction verification and data storage are distributed to each node to eliminate data monopoly and manipulation, ensure network democracy and transparency, and ensure that the ledger information is authentic and reliable, so that each participant can equally control the fate of the network.

Quantum Encryption Escort
The built-in quantum encryption algorithm generates a 264-bit Hash, which integrates transaction details and network dynamics, such as block height and node activity, making the data indestructible. Even when quantum computing strikes, it can still maintain its defense line and protect user privacy and asset security.

Universal Participation Empowerment
Lower the participation threshold, and ordinary users can become nodes by installing the APP. Idle computing power and storage of daily mobile phones are used for blockchain maintenance. Accounting and verification are easy, integrating blockchain into people's lives and stimulating unlimited potential.

Technical operation process
Node access
Users download the APP, the background automatically generates a public and private key pair, the private key is encrypted and stored locally, the public key is broadcast to the entire network, and the access is announced. The node starts port monitoring, sends and receives connection, transaction, and block information, and regularly sends survival signals to maintain the stability of the network topology.

Transaction process
The user initiates a transaction on the mobile phone, fills in the recipient, amount and other information, and encapsulates it into the local transaction pool.
The local node quickly requests encryption from the distributed main server cluster and carries the original transaction data. The server performs quantum encryption calculations and returns the hash value, which is full of information from the entire network.
The node marks the transaction encryption completed, broadcasts the hash value, and starts synchronization across the entire network, and the transaction information spreads rapidly.

Block generation and consensus
The node transaction pool starts packaging when the transaction meets the standard or exceeds the time limit without a new block. Collect legal transactions and sort them into original blocks in time.
Calculate the block header, merge the previous block Hash, Merkle root, timestamp, etc., use quantum encryption derivative algorithm to encrypt again, get the final Hash, and complete the assembly of the new block.
The new block is broadcast to the entire network, and the node verifies the legitimacy based on local data and consensus algorithm (such as improved Byzantine fault tolerance), and the compliant block is chained to each node account book.

Data storage and synchronization
Nodes allocate disks to store blockchain data on demand, and new blocks, new transactions or network changes trigger synchronization. Actively request the latest data from active nodes, update the local after verification, and ensure the consistency of the account book.
Open source collaboration
This project adheres to the open source concept, and the code is hosted on Github. Developers are welcome to contribute code, make suggestions, and report vulnerabilities. Together, we will overcome the difficulties of quantum encryption integration and mobile terminal optimization, and explore more application possibilities. Comply with open source specifications, respect intellectual property rights, and create high-quality projects together.--->
