Detailed Explanation of Key Directories

docs/
This directory stores documents throughout the project's life cycle. From the initial README for a first acquaintance to the technical whitepaper for in-depth exploration, and then to contribution guidelines and API documentation, it meets the needs of different audiences in one stop: developers can understand the architecture and start development; users can learn usage techniques; partners can grasp the overall picture of the project, promoting a healthy cycle of the project ecosystem.

src/
This is the core battlefield, with each subdirectory having a clear division of labor:
blockchain/: The cornerstone code of the blockchain. block.py shapes the block form and controls hash generation; chain.py links blocks together to maintain the consistency and stability of the ledger; transaction.py activates the transaction flow, which is the key to value transfer.

crypto/
The core area of encryption. quantum_encrypt.py harnesses quantum computing power to encrypt transactions; utils.py provides behind-the-scenes support to ensure a smooth encryption process.

network/
The hub of network communication. node.py brings mobile phone nodes to life, sending and receiving data and integrating into the network; protocol.py sets the rules to ensure orderly communication among nodes; server.py schedules resources and provides critical services on the server side.

utils/
The silent guardians of the project. config.py precisely allocates parameters to adapt to different environments; logger.py records the entire process, allowing for traceability and problem-solving when issues arise.

tests/
The two guardians of quality: Unit tests in unit/ target the independent functions of functions and classes, seeing the details; integration tests in integration/ simulate real-world scenarios to examine the overall system collaboration. With both in place, they ensure the quality of the code.

scripts/
These are handy assistants for operation and maintenance, simplifying startup, initialization, and monitoring processes, reducing costs and increasing efficiency to keep the project running smoothly.

setup.py
The project's entry point, it enables one-click installation of dependencies, project deployment, and kicks off the exploration journey, bridging the "last mile" from code to operation.
We hope this directory structure explanation helps you quickly locate the code and develop efficiently. If you have any suggestions for optimizing the structure or questions about the code, feel free to communicate and feedback in the community at any time.
