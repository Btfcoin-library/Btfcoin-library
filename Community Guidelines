Welcome to the BTFCoin Community!

Whether you are a developer, an enthusiast, or an explorer in the blockchain industry, we truly appreciate your choice to join the BTFCoin community. Here, we all gather because of our passion for cutting-edge blockchain technology and our vision for the BTFCoin project. To foster a friendly, efficient, and innovative communication environment, we hope everyone adheres to the following guidelines:

Communication Etiquette
Show Respect: Community members come from diverse backgrounds with varying technical levels. Regardless of the questions, opinions, or suggestions others put forward, please treat them with respect and inclusiveness. Refrain from personal attacks, insulting language, discriminatory remarks, and avoid using inappropriate emoticons or overly aggressive expressions. Remember, we come together because of common interests, and friendly exchanges are the key to sparking creative ideas.
Use Civilized Language: Use civilized and appropriate language throughout the communication process. Avoid vulgar words and online hostility. When replying to others, strive to maintain a calm tone and clear logic. When encountering differences, rationally state your own views, try to understand the other person's position, and resolve conflicts through peaceful communication rather than getting into pointless arguments.

Problem Feedback and Discussion
Ask Precise Questions: If you encounter technical difficulties, usage doubts, or project-related issues, when starting a topic, please describe the problem background, reproduction steps, attempted solutions, and expected results in detail. For example, when reporting a code error, attach the full error message, the code snippet where the error occurred, and details of the running environment to facilitate others in quickly locating and helping to solve the problem. Vague and broad questions are not conducive to obtaining effective help.
Categorize Discussions: The community has different sections, such as "Technical Exchange" for discussing code implementation and algorithm optimization; "Product Suggestions" focusing on product feature improvements and user experience enhancements; "Project Updates" for releasing information about version updates and roadmap adjustments, etc. When posting content, please choose the appropriate section based on the nature of the topic to avoid clutter and improve communication efficiency.

Code and Documentation Contributions
Follow the Specifications: The detailed code style, documentation writing, and contribution process are described in Contribution_Guide.md. Please follow them strictly. Before submitting code, conduct self-tests to ensure the functionality is normal and there are no obvious bugs; when updating documentation, ensure the information is accurate and the expression is clear, matching the actual code situation, so that newcomers can efficiently carry out work following the documentation.
Actively Respond to Feedback: When the code or documentation you submitted triggers discussions or receives review comments, please actively participate in the communication. Patiently answer others' questions, humbly accept reasonable suggestions, and promptly make modifications as required to jointly promote the high-quality progress of the project.

Community Activity Participation
Online Webinars: The community will hold online webinars from time to time, inviting industry experts and core developers to share cutting-edge technology and project progress. Everyone is welcome to sign up enthusiastically and attend on time. Actively interact, ask questions, and exchange ideas during the webinar. After the event, apply the knowledge you've learned to actual development or promotion work to promote the overall technical improvement of the community.
Offline Meetups: If conditions permit to organize offline gatherings, this is an excellent opportunity for in-depth face-to-face communication and networking. Follow the activity organization rules, arrive on time, and abide by the venue order. During the exchange, maintain an open attitude, share practical experiences and cooperation opportunities to enhance the cohesion of the community.

Violation Handling
For behaviors that violate the community guidelines, the administrators reserve the right to take corresponding measures, including but not limited to issuing warnings, deleting违规内容, restricting speaking privileges, banning accounts, etc., depending on the severity of the violation. Those who violate the rules multiple times or with severe circumstances will be permanently expelled from the community. This is to maintain a healthy community ecosystem and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the majority of members.
Thank you again for being a member of the BTFCoin community. By working together, we are certain to take the project to new heights and create a glorious chapter in blockchain technology innovation!
